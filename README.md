# blazor-static-web-app

Example Blazor Wasm application, with Azure Function API

This application is the same as built in my talk [Deploying Client Side Blazor to a Static Web App](https://sessionize.com/s/stacy-cashmore/deploying_client_side_blazor_to_a_s/37319).

The application will compile and run locally, and can be extended as wished.

The github workflow file is included for completeness, but not usable. To deploy the application a new workflow file is needed, which will be created when a new [Azure Static Web App](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/static-web-apps?WT.mc_id=AZ-MVP-5003925) is created in the portal.
