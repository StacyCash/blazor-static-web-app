# blazor-static-web-app

Example Blazor Wasm application, with Azure Function API

This application is the same as built in my talk [Deploying Client Side Blazor to a Static Web App](https://sessionize.com/s/stacy-cashmore/deploying_client_side_blazor_to_a_s/37319).

The talks can be found here:
 * [.NET Frontend Day 2021](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1VzG0PIcfq8)
 * [4DotNet Conf](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PLEi7UUs4N8&trk)

The application will compile and run locally, and can be extended as wished.

The github workflow file is included for completeness, but not usable.

To deploy the application it needs to be removed, and a new workflow file should be created. To do this create a new [Azure Static Web App](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/static-web-apps?WT.mc_id=AZ-MVP-5003925) in the portal.
